\title{The function to fit OPM algorithm for variable selection under two data-types with least square in Step I and OPM in step 2}
\usage{
fit.RAWOPM(Y, X, LAMBDA, ncores, test, train, IndMa)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{is the binary vector of class labels}

\item{X}{is the predictor matrix structured as [Macrovariable, Microvariables]}

\item{LAMBDA}{is the penalty term}

\item{ncores}{stands for the number of cores to be used for parallelization (for Windows always use 1)}

\item{test}{stands for the set of indices in Y to be the testing set}

\item{train}{stands for the set of indices in Y to be the training set}

\item{IndMa}{is the number of Macrovariables (It means that the function will consider the first IndMa many predictors as Macro predictors)}
}
\value{
fit.RAWOPM returns a list of errors (out-of-sample miss-classification error rate and in-sample miss-classification error rate in that order) and the coefficients \cr
}
\description{
Takes the response Y (a binary vector of class labels) and predictor matrix X
