# OPM
Combining phenotypic and genomic data to improve prediction of binary traits

Each folder contain the R code for the respective case. In the first part of the code we have the function with full description of the input and output variables. 

At the end of each of those files there is an example usage of the function. 


To install the package use the following R command

devtools::install_github("royarkaprava/OPM/OPMpackage")

Open the Usage.R file. The first two lines will install and load the package. After that you need to download the simulated data.rda file separately and put the path in setwd("") to load the data and run the functions.
